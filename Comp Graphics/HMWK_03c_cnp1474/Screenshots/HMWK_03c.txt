Programming Assignment 03c

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:

  * Add perspective projection to the clipping, parallel
    projection mesh display program.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background:

  * In PA 03b, you enhanced the parallel projection mesh display
    program to include optional Cohen-Sutherland line clipping.

  * The next step is to allow the user to select whether the
    projection should be parallel or perspective and, in the
    perspective case, permit the adjustment of the view distance.

  * The perspective projection mode will be selected using another
    Settings menu entry.  The view distance will be set using an
    askfloat dialog box triggered by a button press.

  * The calculation of perspective projection coordinates is
    carried out using the method described in the handout
    "4303 Projections.pdf" (distributed on 2019 Feb 20 in the
    Course Materials section on Blackboard).

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

  1. Download HMWK_03c_dalioba.zip from Blackboard.

  2. Unzip the file somewhere convenient.

  3. Change 'dalioba' in the name of the directory to your NetID.
     (Your NetID is three letters followed by four or five digits.
      The directory name will now be something like
      'hmwk_03c_abc1234'.)

  4. Look in that directory.

  5. Surprise!  There are NO Python files.  You should use your
     files from PA 03b as the basis for this assignment.

  6. You have to make some changes to the myWidgets.py file to
     supply the 'Perspective' entry in the settings menu and to
     add a 'Distance' button to the toolbar.

  7. There are some changes to the ModelData.py file so that the
     specified transform now includes the view distance.  Also,
     the transformation of vertices now has to take the
     possibility of perspective projection into account.

  8. You next have to make some changes to the myGraphics.py file
     so the create_graphic_objects() method will accept the
     'Perspective' setting and then use that setting when
     transforming vertices from world space to screen space.

  9. Try out your nifty perspective-or-parallel projecting mesh
     clipping and drawing program using the pillars-nine.txt mesh.
     The pillars are 10 units high, so set the view distance to a
     number greater than that.  Turn clipping on and off to see
     the effect on the display.  Turn perspective projection on
     and off to see the effect on the display.

     You should see something like what's shown in the screenshot
     files.  (The names of the screenshot files include the view
     distance and whether clipping was on or off and whether
     perspective or parallel projection was used.)

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Make a zipfile of your 'hmwk_03c_abc1234' directory (where
'abc1234' is replaced with YOUR NetID) and submit it on
Blackboard as your results for this assignment.

Your submission should be a zipfile that has exactly one item in
it, a directory named 'hmwk_03c_abc1234' (where 'abc1234' is
YOUR NetID).  Inside that directory should be the source files
for your solution.  All you really need to submit are the Python
files (ModelData.py, constructTransform.py, main.py, myWidgets.py,
myGraphics.py, and CohenSutherland.py).

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:
  1. Ensure your submission is packaged EXACTLY as described
     above.  Submissions in the wrong format score ZERO points.

  2. You can prompt the user for a float value by using the
     simple.dialog.askfloat() function call:

        f = simpledialog.askfloat( "Title", "Prompt?",
              initialvalue = theOldValue, minvalue = someMinVal )

     On return, if f is None, that means the user hit the Cancel
     button.  theOldValue will appear already entered in the
     dialog.  minvalue is the least value that the user is
     allowed to enter.

  5. FYI, to get all this to work, I made NO changes to the
     reference implementation of main.py, constructTransform.py,
     and CohenSutherland.py from PA 03b.

  6. In ModelData.py

     Augment the getTransformedVertex() method to take an
     additional parameter, doPerspective, so it knows whether to
     do parallel or perspective projection.  If doPerspective is
     True, project the vertex's x and y coordinates according to
     the method given in the handout before doing the sx, sy, ax,
     ay operations.  (Seven (7) new lines of code.)

     Be careful!  If the distance is 0 or less than or equal to
     the vertex's z coordinate, map the point to the origin!

  9. So that's what?  About 25 new lines of code in total?  (Not
     counting blank lines and the import lines.)

     Not bad for a program that will now display arbtrarily
     complex meshes in parallel OR perspective projection and clip
     triangles that are outside the viewing region.

 10. The Pillars screenshots were captured with a canvas size of
     600 x 600.  The settings for Clipping and Parallel or
     Perspective projection are indicated in the name of the file.
